# Groceries API
## A simple groceries inventory backend written in Python with UPC lookup support.

This program is a personal solution to a groceries inventory system. Currently, the backend DB is designed and can ingest 
information provided the info is the correct format. Tests have not yet been implemented. Neither has 
type checking and error handling. 

The frontend planned will be console based, but an html implementation should be pretty easy due to the separated API. 

## Planned for backend:

- Error Handling
- Type Checking
- Documentation
- Tests
- Nested schema for nested "offers" in "items'
- WSGI Implementation
- Dockerized? (I don't have experience in this yet, but I need it, so it shall be done)

I will be officially choosing a license soon. In the meantime, this software is open source and can be modified and included in projects
with NON-COMMERCIAL USES ONLY. Attribution will be required. If your use case predates my license choice, please contact
me and I will expedite licensing.
